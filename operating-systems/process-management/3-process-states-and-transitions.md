# Process States and Transitions

## Q1: What are the main states a process can be in?

The main states a process can be in are:

1. New: The process is being created 
2. Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
3. Running: The process is being executed on a processor
4. Waiting (or Blocked): The process is waiting for some event to occur
5. Terminated: The process has finished execution

## Q2: Can you explain the "New" state with an example?

The "New" state is when a process is first created but not yet ready to run. For example, when you double-click on an application icon, the operating system starts creating a new process. It allocates memory and resources for the process, loads the program code into memory, and sets up initial data structures. This all happens in the "New" state before the process is ready to actually start running.

## Q3: What happens when a process is in the "Ready" state?

When a process is in the "Ready" state, it's like a runner on the starting line, waiting for the gun to go off. The process has everything it needs to run, but the CPU is currently busy with other processes. All "Ready" processes are kept in a queue, waiting for their turn to use the CPU. The operating system's scheduler decides which process from the "Ready" queue will run next.

## Q4: How does a process transition from "Ready" to "Running" state?

The transition from "Ready" to "Running" happens when the operating system's scheduler selects the process to run on a CPU. This is called "dispatching" or "scheduling" the process.

For example, let's say you have three programs open: a text editor, a web browser, and a music player. They might all be in the "Ready" state. The scheduler then decides, "Okay, let's run the text editor now," and moves it to the "Running" state by allocating CPU time to it.

## Q5: What causes a process to go into the "Waiting" state?

A process enters the "Waiting" (or "Blocked") state when it needs to wait for something before it can continue running. Common reasons include:

1. Waiting for user input (like waiting for you to type something)
2. Waiting for a file to be read from disk
3. Waiting for a network response

For instance, when you're using a word processor and you click "Save," the process might enter the "Waiting" state while it waits for the file to be written to the disk.

## Q6: How does a process transition from "Running" to "Terminated" state?

A process moves to the "Terminated" state when it finishes its execution or is forcefully terminated. This can happen in a few ways:

1. Normal completion: The process finishes all its tasks.
2. Exit call: The process calls an exit function to terminate itself.
3. Fatal error: An unrecoverable error occurs.
4. Killed by another process: Another process (often initiated by the user) forces this process to terminate.

For example, when you finish using a calculator app and close it, or when you use Task Manager to force-quit an unresponsive program, the process moves to the "Terminated" state.

## Q7: What is a context switch and when does it occur?

A context switch is when the CPU switches from executing one process to another. It's like a chef switching from cooking one dish to another. This occurs when:

1. A higher priority process becomes ready to run.
2. The current running process goes into a waiting state.
3. The time slice allocated to the current process expires.

During a context switch, the operating system saves the state of the currently running process and loads the saved state of the next process to run. This allows multiple processes to share the CPU, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.

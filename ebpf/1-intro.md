# Introduction to eBPF

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology in the Linux kernel that allows users to run sandboxed programs in kernel space. Originally designed for packet filtering, eBPF has evolved to support a wide range of use cases, including networking, security, tracing, and observability.

## Key Features

- **Safety**: eBPF programs are verified before execution to ensure they do not compromise kernel stability.
- **Performance**: Programs run efficiently in kernel space, reducing overhead.
- **Flexibility**: eBPF can be used for monitoring, filtering, and custom logic without modifying kernel source code.

## Common Use Cases

- Network traffic analysis and filtering
- Performance monitoring and tracing
- Security enforcement and auditing

## Getting Started

To use eBPF, you typically write programs in C or use higher-level languages and tools like BCC or libbpf. These programs are loaded into the kernel using system calls and interact with user space via maps and events.

eBPF is supported in modern Linux kernels (version 4.x and above).

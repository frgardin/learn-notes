# What are tracing, snooping, sampling, profiling, and observability?

## 1. Tracing
- Event-based recording that captures raw events and their metadata.  
- Examples: `strace` (system calls), `tcpdump` (network packets).  
- Can generate large amounts of data, often requiring post-processing.  
- With BPF, events can be processed and summarized in real time to reduce cost.  
- Terms like *snooping*, *event dumping*, and *tracing* often mean the same thing.  

## 2. Sampling
- Records only a subset of measurements at regular intervals to create a “profile” of the system.  
- Example: `profile` (BPF), which can sample code execution every 10 ms.  
- **Advantage:** lower overhead because fewer events are measured.  
- **Disadvantage:** provides an approximate view and may miss important events.  

## 3. Observability
- The ability to understand a system through observation.  
- Includes tracing tools, sampling tools, and fixed-counter tools.  
- Does **not** include benchmarking tools, which modify the system’s state by generating test workloads.  
- The BPF tools discussed are used for observability with programmatic tracing.
